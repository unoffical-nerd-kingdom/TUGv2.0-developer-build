 Disclaimer regarding the TUGv2.0 Developer build and the  Unofficial Nerdkingdom Community
 

All provided assets such as models, textures, sounds and tags are created and/or owned by Nerd Kingdom inc and I GOT GAMES.

will be fixed later but in short: we do not claim we are NK ex staff or that we own ANY of the things within the build
But we do claim to be able to keep this on github under fair use and for achivial purposes that is a attempt to make sure this game does not be abadon, which at this point most likely has

this build and github gives you a noncommerical lisence to edit , decompile, and build mods for TUGv2.0 under creative commons

with this is mind we hold no responsibility to anyone who uses this build, this is made "as is" and we cannot help you beyond what ever we have said within the txt.

we are not held responsibile for any copyright infringement that may have unintentional occured by this unoffical release. we further state we have spent a good deal of time makin sure we are within our legal right to release this build as free to use non-commerical program.

we  assert that we have tried to contact Nerdkingdom and I Got games for the past 2 years, with no response. The law states the copyright owner must make a attempt to protect their inteutal properties or they are seen as a abandoned properties

lastly we would like to state we obtained this build from a backer/ modder who got into a developer/ modder only release, and as far as he says there was nothing in it at the time that applied that he couldn't release it at some point or had signed anything that could have prevent him from sharing this game, that was supposed to be free and open soure fo the community invovlment 


in the end we hold molibilty for the copy and distrubution of tugv2.0, that we will say this build is a attempt at sharing it with everyone and we will continue to do say as of this writing we have not heard from any of the 2 compaines, while this doesn't meany we can do whatever we want, but again the 2 said companies have to make a effort at contacting us for any legal problems they may or may not have had

it is up to IGG NOT not unofficial Nerd kingdom  to come forward with a issue of this build, as we do and assert that along with other things, we are legaly bound to bring this and anything else to open source until we are told otherwise 

this is a rough quick edit, not to taken as the final version
